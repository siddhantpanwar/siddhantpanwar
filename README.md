# ðŸš€ About Me
Iâ€™m a self-taught entrepreneur and innovator, driven by a passion for technology, coding, and business. My journey began in 8th grade when I wrote my first lines of code, and I havenâ€™t stopped building since!

By 11th grade, I chose to step away from the conventional education system, recognizing its limitations on the creative freedom I needed to innovate and grow. Iâ€™ve embraced self-learning and independent exploration, delving into coding, design, and entrepreneurship to carve my unique path.

## ðŸŽ¯ My Mission
Iâ€™m on a relentless quest to:
- Build transformative ventures that push boundaries and create impact.
- Expand my network and collaborate with like-minded innovators.
- Redefine success on my own terms, driven by growth, creativity, and a future-forward vision.

## ðŸ’¡ My Core Beliefs
- **Learning never stops.** Everything I know, Iâ€™ve learned independently, proving that curiosity and passion are the real teachers.
- **Think outside the box.** Traditional education is not a one-size-fits-all solution. Creativity thrives when you step off the beaten path.
- **Impact > conformity.** Iâ€™m here to challenge norms, embrace innovation, and build the future I want to see.

## ðŸ”§ My Toolbox
- **Programming:** JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Next.js, React Native
- **Design:** Tailwind, Figma, Adobe Suite, UI / UX
- **Business:** Strategic branding, venture building, AI-driven solutions, Systems Creation
